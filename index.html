                    <p>All the colors on this page are declaired as variables. Neat!</p>
                    <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">The style for this link is from a partial file. These are great for modularity!</a>

            <h3>This h3 is not nested! That's why it's style is different.</h3>
            <p>The div below is sized in the main style file by calling a variable in a module! sizes.$100 in _sizes.scss to be exact, making it 100 by 100 pixels.</p>
            <div class="module-sized">

                <p>Woah! It's also been rotated! That was done with a mixin. A block of CSS that I want to keep DRY. I just reference it in the div's selector and I can even pass it variables just like a function or method!</p>
