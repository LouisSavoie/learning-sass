            <div class="frame-outer">
                <h3>This h3 is nested in the frame-outer!</h3>
                <div class="frame-inner">
                    <p>All the colors on this page are declaired as variables. Neat!</p>
                    <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">The style for this link is from a partial file. These are great for modularity!</a>
                </div>

            <h3>This h3 is not nested! That's why it's style is different.</h3>
            <p>The div below is sized in the main style file by calling a variable in a module! sizes.$100 in _sizes.scss to be exact, making it 100 by 100 pixels.</p>
            <div class="module-sized">

                <p>Woah! It's also been rotated! That was done with a mixin. A block of CSS that I want to keep DRY. I just reference it in the div's selector and I can even pass it variables just like a function or method!</p>

                <p>This text does not inherit any extended properties.</p>

                    <h4>Operators</h4>
                    Doing math in your CSS is very helpful. Sass has a handful of standard math operators like +, -, *, /, and %. In our example we're going to do some simple math to calculate widths for an aside & article.
                </article>
                <aside role="complementary">
                    We've created a very simple fluid grid, based on 960px. Operations in Sass let us do something like take pixel values and convert them to percentages without much hassle.
